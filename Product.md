# Product Requirements: AI Project Planning Assistant (PPA)

## 1. Project Vision and Core Concept

**Project Title:** AI Project Planning Assistant (PPA)
**Short Name:** PPA
**Purpose:** A full-stack AI-driven tool to help software developers plan complex projects through smart context management, feature brainstorming, and iterative prompt refinement for AI coding agents (e.g., Jules, Cursor, Claude, Gemini).

PPA acts as a bridge between human developers and AI coding assistants. It is designed to streamline the pre-production phase of software development by providing a structured environment for brainstorming, planning, and generating high-quality prompts for AI agents. By managing project context and leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), PPA helps developers translate high-level ideas into actionable, well-defined project plans.

## 2. Core Features

### 1. Authentication & Onboarding
-   **Secure Sign-Up/Login:** Users can create an account and log in using Supabase email/password authentication.
-   **OAuth Integration:** Support for third-party authentication providers like Google and GitHub.
-   **User Profile:** A dedicated space for users to manage their profile information and set preferences, such as a default AI persona for generating project plans.

### 2. Project Management
-   **CRUD Operations:** Users can create, read, update, and delete projects. Each project will store essential metadata, including its name and the persona used for AI interactions.
-   **Context File Management:** Users can upload and manage context files (e.g., documents, code snippets, specifications) for each project. These files will be stored securely and associated with the respective project.
-   **Automatic Timestamps:** The system will automatically track when projects are created and last updated.

### 3. Prompt Studio
-   **Centralized Editor:** An intuitive editor for writing, refining, and saving prompts for AI coding agents.
-   **AI-Powered Suggestions:** Integration with the Gemini API to provide suggestions for improving prompt clarity, brevity, and tone.
-   **Structured Output Generation:** The ability to generate structured outputs, such as tasks, user stories, and technical specifications, from unstructured prompts.
-   **Version Control:** All prompts will be versioned, allowing users to track changes and revert to previous versions.

### 4. AI Project Brainstorming
-   **Idea Generation:** Users can provide a high-level goal, preferred tech stack, and any constraints to receive AI-generated project ideas and feature suggestions.
-   **Roadmap Creation:** The AI will generate a comprehensive project plan, including a feature backlog, potential risks, and key milestones.
-   **Structured Data Conversion:** Users will have the option to convert the AI's output into structured data within the Supabase database (e.g., creating tasks from a generated list).

### 5. Prompt Refinement System
-   **Iterative Refinement:** A "Refine" button that sends a meta-prompt to the Gemini API to improve the quality of the current prompt.
-   **Diff Viewer:** A side-by-side comparison to visualize the differences between prompt versions.
-   **Multiple Export Options:** The ability to export prompts in various formats, including Markdown, JSON, and plain text.

### 6. Collaboration (Phase 2)
-   **Team Management:** Project owners will be able to invite team members to collaborate on projects.
-   **Shared Access:** Permissions system for shared view/edit access to projects and prompts.
-   **Activity Log:** A log of all significant activities and changes within a project.
